# Honors Thesis
This repo contains my honors thesis, _Evaluating Player Decisions in Ethical Simulations_. As a part of being in UMass's [Commonwealth Honors College](https://www.umass.edu/honors/), I was expected to research and write a thesis on some topic of particular interest. Under the direction of my advisor, [Professor Leon Osterweil](http://laser.cs.umass.edu/people/ljo.html), I worked towards implementing an evaluation mechanism into an ethical simulation we were developing. 

Teaching students how to navigate ethical dilemmas in the workplace is something that's absolutely _essential_ in today's world, but it's so often an afterthought in so many college cirriciulums. As a response to this, Professor Osterweil had the idea of developing an interactive simulation to expose students to a theoretical dilemma. Over the course of the year I worked alongside him, I wrote my own ethical dilemma scenario, worked to implement it into the simulation framework that our team was developing, and created a mechanism by which player decisions could be evaluated. My thesis was focused on this evaluation mechanism! 

You can read the thesis by opening the "Thesis.pdf" file in the root of the repo! (The auxiliary materials mentioned in the Appendix are found in the corresponding folder.)
